This project explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and human emotions. By leveraging wearable technology data, I delve into how biometric indicators can be used to understand and predict emotional states. The project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including deep learning and transformer models, to analyze both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Mood State Generation and Classification
A synthetic dataset is used to generate mood descriptions using a pre-trained GPT-2 model. These descriptions are then classified into predefined mood states using various deep learning models, including an Ensemble model and a BERT model.

### Part 2: Stress Level Classification from Real-World Data
Using real-world data, stress levels are classified into distinct categories. This part of the project involves the application of classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.

## Methodology
- **Data Processing:** Includes loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data from wearables.
- **Model Training:** Involves training deep learning models for text generation and mood classification.
- **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated based on metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, providing insights into their performance in identifying emotional states.

## Results
The findings highlight the superior performance of the Ensemble model in classifying mood states in synthetic data, while the Random Forest model excelled in handling real-world data for stress level classification.
